### PBJ Process Document October 24, 2017

1. Gather supplies
   1. Get a plate from the cupboard. 
      1. *Plate size constraint* – Choose a plate that is at least big enough to fit a slice of bread when it lays flat on the plate. 
   2. Get a butter knife and teaspoon from the utensil drawer.
   3. Get the peanut butter from the pantry.
      1. *Decision* – If you have different kinds of peanut butter, i.e. creamy, chunky, almond, etc., choose one.
   4. Get the jelly from the refrigerator.
      1. *Decision* – If you have different kinds of jelly, i.e. strawberry, red currant, grape, etc., choose one.
   5. Get the bread loaf from the bread box, refrigerator, pantry or wherever your bread is kept.
      1. *Decision* – If you have different kinds of bread on hand, i.e. white, wheat, sourdough, etc., choose one.
      2. *Bread choice constraints* – It is best to choose bread style that is not sliced too thick or too thin. Optimal thickness of the bread slice is between 3/8” and 1/2”. Slices that are too thick can make the sandwich heavy and dry. Slices that are too thin may allow the jelly to soak through and the bread will become soggy.
2. Open the bread bag and take out two slices.
3. Lay the two slices of bread flat on the plate next to each other with the flat sides of each slice adjacent to each other. 
4. Close the bread bag back up.
5. Open the jelly jar.
6. Use the teaspoon to scoop a spoon full of jelly out of the jar.
7. Transfer the jelly on the spoon to one of the bread slices on the plate. (It doesn't matter which slice at this point.)
8. Use the teaspoon to spread the jelly out on the bread. 
9. Repeat steps 7-8 until the desired amount of jelly is on the bread. The optimal amount of jelly is an evenly spread layer of between 1/16" and 1/8". Note: If you've used a bread slice that is on the thicker side, greater than 1/2", you can add a little extra jelly, up to 1/4" in thickness.
10. Discard the spoon into the sink.
11. Close the jelly jar back up.
12. Open the peanut butter jar.
13. Use the butter knife to scoop a dollop of peanut butter out of the jar.
14. Use the butter knife to spread the peanut butter onto the bread slice that does not have the jelly on it.
15. Repeat steps 13-14 until the desired amount of peanut butter is on the bread. The optimal amount of peanut butter is an evenly spread layer of between 1/8" and 1/4" thick. Note: Thicker bread slices, greater than 1/2" can take more peanut butter, up to 3/8". 
16. *(Optional Step) Scoop one last small dollop of peanut butter from the jar and feed it to the drooling dog. *
17.  Dependency 
      1. If step 16 is opted in: 
         1. Discard the knife into the sink.
         2. Rinse the dog slobber off your hands.
         3. Dry your hands. 
      2. If step 16 is skipped, set the knife aside on the counter for possible later use.
18. Close the peanut butter jar.
19. Pick up the bread slice with the peanut butter on it and place it on top of the bread slice with the jelly on it, peanut butter side down. 
20. *Decision* – 
    1. Eat the PBJ whole – No further action needed; Eat the PBJ
    2. Cut the PBJ in half – 
       1. If step 16 was opted in, get another butter knife from the utensil drawer. If step 16 was skipped, pick up the butter knife from steps 13-15.
       2. Cut the sandwich in half from any direction, i.e. across, on the diagonal, or any angle desired
       3. No further action needed; Eat the PBJ
21. Cleanup
    1. Put the peanut butter back in the pantry
    2. Put the jelly back in the refrigerator
    3. Put the bread bag back in the bread box
    4. Put any remaining utensils and your plate in the sink.
